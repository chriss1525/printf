# printf

We are creating our own _printf!! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

## Part 1

Creating a printf function that takes in identifiers, c, s, i and d after the % sign.

This _printf function at this point can do the following;

- print a simple string with no modifiers present
- take in the modifier % and loop through the arguments given to find the variable type
- print varibles given based on identifier occuring after %
- print both positive and negative integers

## Part 2

Adding more complex modifiers to the function

At this point, the _printf function should run almost similarly to the printf function
